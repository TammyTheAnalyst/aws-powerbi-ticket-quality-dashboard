# ðŸ“Š AWS + Power BI: Ticket Quality Dashboard



This mini project simulates what a Quality Assurance Analyst might do in a contact center environment using AWS and Power BI.

---

## Project Summary

Support ticket data is stored in AWS S3 and downloaded for analysis in Power BI. The goal is to identify trends in agent performance and SLA compliance, just like a QA analyst would in a real-world role.

## Dashboard Features

- **Tickets Handled by Agent**: Ava, Ben, Leo, and Jade each handled a different number of support tickets.
  Ava handled the most, while Leo and Jade had fewer. This clustered column chart gives a quick view of agent workload.

- **SLA Met vs Missed by Agent**: The stacked bar chart shows how each agent performed on SLA compliance.
  Ben and Leo met all SLAs, while Ava and Jade had a mix of met and missed. This highlights who may need coaching.
