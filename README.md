# ðŸ“Š AWS + Power BI: Ticket Quality Dashboard



This mini project simulates what a Quality Assurance Analyst might do in a contact center environment using AWS and Power BI.

---

## Project Summary

Support ticket data is stored in AWS S3 and downloaded for analysis in Power BI. The goal is to identify trends in agent performance and SLA compliance, just like a QA analyst would in a real-world role.
